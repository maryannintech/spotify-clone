# Spotify Clone

###### I attempted to clone [Spotify's](https://open.spotify.com/) web page to practice my HTML and CSS skills. This is the [layout] I'm following. The font i used was [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat) as this is the closest I could find to match the font Spotify is using.
